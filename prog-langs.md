## Programming languages

Don't believe the hype.

Remember where your roots are. Understand your strong and weak sides.

### Object Pascal
Modern version of Pascal.

It has a sane module system. It has better strings and arrays.

I like the syntax. I like its safety and well-structured code.

Fast compilation!

Delphi and Lazarus (free).

### PHP
More than 80% of the web uses PHP.

One file = one endpoint

Easy to deploy

### C
I can't read C code very well. Too many obscure hacks. Too many different ways to do one thing.

Good fit for a very smart hacker.

### JavaScript, C++, C#, Java
Tried them all. Really tried. But No, thanks.
