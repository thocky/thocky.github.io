## A001: Compromise

First, understand this important truth:

Every idea comes with a cost. 

See every technology as a compromise of some kind.

Make no general opinions.

Examples of options that are not always the best choice:

- *Object-Oriented Programming*
- *Databases*
- *C/UNIX culture*
- *IDEs*
- *x86/64 architecture*
- *General OS's*
- *Microservices*
- *Containers*
- *Virtual Machines*
- *Web applications*
